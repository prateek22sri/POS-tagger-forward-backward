# Forward-backward Algorithm 
This project contains two implementations of Forward and Backward Algorithm. The one which is without normalizing is faster but not the probability table is not acurate although the results are still the same. The jupyter notebook explains the algorithm and it also tells the difference between the two files in the last note.
